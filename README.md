## Project Overview

The primary artifact in this ePortfolio is a Python-based text adventure game titled **Protect and Serve**. Originally developed as a foundational exercise in procedural programming, the project was enhanced throughout the capstone course to meet professional software standards and to reflect skills gained during the Computer Science program.

## Enhancements Summary

### 1. Software Design and Engineering
The game code was refactored into a modular, object-oriented structure. The original single-file script was split into multiple organized modules (`player.py`, `mechanics.py`, `config.py`, `game.py`) to improve readability, scalability, and maintainability.
This is much more efficient rather than it's original state where the entire game was being run in the same file of code. This would mean the entire file would compile when the game was run.

### 2. Algorithms and Data Structures
The command parser was enhanced to intelligently interpret directional input and manage game flow logic more efficiently. This allows a simpler more user-friendly command array for directional input. Inventory management and item tracking were also improved to better reflect the use of core data structures like sets and dictionaries.

### 3. Databases
A JSON-based save/load system was implemented to allow players to persist game state. This enhancement demonstrates the application of structured data handling and file I/O operations to support user session continuity. This allows the player to save the game at checkpoints throughout the game and return to their progress at their own convenience.
